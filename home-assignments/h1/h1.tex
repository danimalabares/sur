{\huge Home assignment 1: Hopf surfaces and Kodaira surfaces}

\begin{thing4}{Exercise 1.2}\label{exer:1.2}\leavevmode
Prove that a the primary Kodaira surface (defines, as in lecture 1, as a nilmanifold) has trivial canonical bundle.
\end{thing4}

\begin{thing4}{Exercise 1.3}\label{exer:1.3}\leavevmode
Construct a closed, non-degenerate (1,1)-form.
\end{thing4}

\begin{proof}[Solution]\leavevmode
	So the idea is to use, somehow, Lie algebra: \(\mathfrak{g}^*\), the dual of \(\mathsf{Lie}(S^1 \times Heis)\), which is defined as generated by \(x,y,z,t\) and  \([x,y]=z\).
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}\leavevmode
	A \textit{\textbf{classical Hopf surface}} is \(\frac{\mathbb{C}^n}{\left<\gamma\right>}\) with %\(|\gamma(z)|<\lambda|z|\) 
	\(\gamma=\lambda \operatorname{Id}\).

		%A \textit{\textbf{classical Hopf surface}} is \(\frac{\mathbb{C}^n}{\left<\gamma\right>}\) where \(\gamma\) is a contraction: a function such that for every compact subset \(K\) and neighbourhood \(U\) of some point \(x \in M\) there exists \(N>0\) such that \(\gamma^n(K) \subset U\) for all \(n > N\).
%	that puts every compact set \(K\) inside any neighbourhood \(U\) of a given point after a finite number $N$ of iterations, \(\gamma^n(K) \subset U\) for every \(n>N\).
\end{defn}

\begin{thing4}{Exercise 1.4}\label{exer:1.4}\leavevmode
Let \(H\) be a classical Hopf surface.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Prove that the holomorphic tangent bundle \(TH\) {\color{4}(is?)} globally generated (that is, for each \(x \in H\), the projection \(H^{0}(TH)\longrightarrow T_xH\) is surjective).
 \item Prove that \(H^{0}(T^*H)=0\).
\item Prove that \(H^{0}(\operatorname{Sym}^k T^* H)=0\).
\item (*) Prove that \(H^{0}(T^*H)=0\) for any Hopf linear surface.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thing4}

\begin{proof}[Solution]\leavevmode
I guess I just don't know the definition of  \(H^{0}(X)\). Looks like there's some group action involved.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Answer by ChatGPT: the vector fields \(X_k=x_k\frac{\partial }{\partial x_k}\) descend to \(H\): \(X_k(\lambda p)=\lambda X_k(p)\). These vector fields globally generate \(H^0(TH)\) since they do so in the cover  \(\mathbb{C}^n \setminus \{0\} / \left<\gamma\right>\).

		A holomorphic tangent bundle equipped with a transitive group action is globally generated. Indeed: any basis for the tangent space at any point is made into a section via the group action.

	To find a transitive group action on \(H\) we need a group of transformations that preserves de action of \(\gamma\), that is \(Ax=A \lambda x\).

	%we use its cover \(\mathbb{C}^n \setminus\{0\}\) and the action of \(\mathsf{GL}(n,\mathbb{C})\) which is transitive.

	\item {\color{6}Recall: we are trying to show that an invariant 1-form vanishes.} Then you would pair this form with a vector field that 
		%is (generated by the global basis)

\item If a vector bundle is globally generated, then more or less so is its symmetric power. Then we do the same game of taking dual. 
\item A linear contraction is when has eigenvalues of norm smaller than 1. (Unsolved in class.)
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}


\begin{thing4}{Exercise 1.6}\label{exer:1.6}\leavevmode
Let $C$ be a smooth complex curve on a non-projective complex surface \(M\). Assume that \(C \subset M\) admits a positive-dominsional family of deformations. Prove that the $C$ is a genus 1 curve.
\end{thing4}

\begin{proof}[Solution by Yulia]\leavevmode
It's an application of Adjunction Formula.

\begin{remark}\leavevmode
Kodaira theorem (lecture 1). For any non-algebraic surface
\end{remark}
\begin{thm}[Kodaira]\leavevmode
For any non-algebraic surface \(X\), if \(a,b \in \operatorname{NS}(X)= H^{1,1}(X)\cap H^{2}(X,\mathbb{Z})\), with \(a^2=0\), then \(ab=0\).
\end{thm}

Since it deforms  then \(C^2=0\) bid (can't be negative) so \(g(C)=g\). So adjunction says
 \[2g-2=K_X\cdot C+ C^2=0.\]

\begin{proof}[Proof of Adjunction formula by Yulia]\leavevmode
{\color{6}I think it's just something like tensor product of graded algebras like Künneth. ``Determinant takes direct sum to product"} \(C \subset X\).

\[\det T_{X|_{C}}=\det T_C \otimes \det (N_C)\]
but since $C$ is a curve it's al 1 dimensional so we could have not put the det.

This gives \(\Omega^{2}(\Omega_{X|_{C}})=\Lambda^{1}(C) \otimes N^*_C\)
``cotangent times conormal budndles". Right but how to get from there to adjunction formula?

Remember that adjunction formula is about relating ambient manifold to submanifold.

(\textit{\textbf{degree}} of a bundle has to do with taking a section…)

So… the previous equation translates to
\[C^2 + K_X \cdot C = K_C.\]





\[\begin{tikzcd}0\arrow[r]0&T_C\arrow[r]&T_{X|_{C}}\\arrow[r]&N_C\arrow[r]&0\end{tikzcd}\]
\end{proof}
and dualize:
\[\begin{tikzcd}0\arrow[r]&N_C^*\arrow[r]&\Omega^{1}(X|_{C})\arrow[r]&T^*_C\arrow[r]&0\end{tikzcd}\]
\end{proof}
